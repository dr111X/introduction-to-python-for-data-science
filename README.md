# Python for Data Science Workshop (Fall 2019)

## Course materials

Course materials are available [online](https://kaust-vislab.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). 
Our course materials draw heavily from the

lesson developed by the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) community.
